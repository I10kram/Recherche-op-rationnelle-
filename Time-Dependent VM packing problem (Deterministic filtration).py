#VM packing problem (Stackable code) + delay optimization: deterministic filtration maximization algorithm (O(nlogn)): non-intrinsic TI (variable) where truck selection based on item's arrival time makes sense, no predefined value and compatible with closed-form explicit fitness function (this doesn't minimize the number of trucks used unless a truck-based approach is adopted)

#intrinsicality should be matched with elimination otherwise paradox arises
#In this case, TI is just a placeholder variable for TB
