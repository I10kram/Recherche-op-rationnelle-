#Genetic algorithms with boolean representation to time-dependent VM packing problem

#Methylation Hypothesis: To avoid computational redundancy, it's fair to assume that each truck has a pre-defined number of items K = n/m in it (to be known). This hypothesis treats the item-truck insertion operation as a black box aposteriori (meaning it already happened without knowing how)
#Corollary of this assumption: Genetic algorithm will be applied on y[j]s only

#Genetic algorithm: population generated are divided into two types of chromosomes (almost two different populations but linked in an order-specific ) : K-lists (e population of lists with K 1s each) related to the first termm of the objective function (a*sum(TCt*y)), and p-lists (p-truncated of m! population of permuted lists for each K-list). Therefore, Npop = ep (exm! without truncation)
